    An ADT to store 2D points and find a point's nearest neighbor.

    To solve the Nearest Neighbor Search problem (NNS), I chose to
      do a linear search, since it is much simpler than other
      approaches and produces a reasonably good result here.

    Time complexities:
      - insert: O(1)
      - NNS: O(N), where N is the number of points currently inside the container.
